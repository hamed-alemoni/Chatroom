# Chatroom
This is a simple chatroom which written by python and contains client and server files. It runs on localhost and you can change that in code and deploy it on a real server with specific port (my port is 4646) and you can connect to server with n users.I use socket and threading libraries for this.
I hope this was useful. :)
